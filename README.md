# ENSAE_Compressed-Sensing_SDP-GAN

This project is the final one for the course of Compressed Sensing at ENSAE Paris.
It involves rebuilding the paper of "Semidefinite relaxations for certifying robustness toadversarial examples" (Raghunathan A. et al, 2018)
It requires several packages running on Matlab such as yalmip, sedumi during running the optimization calculation part.
